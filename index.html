            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I am [Orikoha Joshua Uzondu] i was born on 2/9/2006 in River State Nigeria, a passionate individual with a deep interest in technology
                and engineering. Growing up, I always had a curiosity about how things work, which led me to study at alt-school
                engineering fields. This curiosity, combined with my desire to make a positive impact in the world, inspired
                me to pursue a career in engineering.</p>
